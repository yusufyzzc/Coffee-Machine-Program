# ☕ Coffee Machine – Python Console Program

A simple yet functional **console-based coffee machine simulation** written in Python.  
It takes user input, checks resources, processes coin transactions and “serves” coffee based on the result.

## Features

- Prompts the user to choose a drink: `espresso`, `latte`, or `cappuccino`
- `"report"` command shows current machine resources
- `"off"` command shuts down the machine
- Checks if enough ingredients are available before making the drink
- Simulates coin input: quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies
- If payment is insufficient, money is refunded
- If payment is enough, the machine gives change, deducts resources, and makes the coffee
